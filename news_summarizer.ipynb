With OpenSearch 2.13, we have made several improvements to search performance and resiliency, OpenSearch Dashboards, and added new features to help you build AI-powered applications. We have introduced concurrent segment search that allows users to query index segments in parallel at the shard level. This offers improved latency for long-running requests that contain aggregations or large ranges. You can now index quantized vectors with FAISS-engine-based k-NN indexes, with potential to reduce memory footprint by as much as 50 percent with minimal impact to accuracy and latency. I/O-based admission control proactively monitors and prevents I/O usage breaches to further improve the resilience of the cluster. Finally, this release introduces tracking of high-latency queries with the top N queries feature. This launch also introduces several features that enable you to build and deploy AI-powered search applications. The new flow framework, helps you to automate the configuration of search and ingest pipeline resources required by advanced search features like semantic, multimodal, and conversational search. This adds to existing capabilities for automating ml-commons resource setup, allowing you to package OpenSearch AI solutions into portable templates. Additionally, we’ve added predefined templates to automate setup for models that are integrated through our connectors to APIs like OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, and Cohere that enable you to build solutions like semantic search.

            "Summary: CNN —A bipartisan group of US lawmakers traveled to Turks and Caicos to press for the release of five Americans detained on ammunition possession charges – but encountered resistance from officials on the island, the group announced Monday.\n",
            "The lawmakers met with Turks and Caicos officials, including the governor, attorney general, minister of tourism and police leaders, the statement from Mullin’s office said.\n",
            "“Unfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,” Mullin said in the statement.\n",
            "Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is “strictly forbidden,” according to a statement from its government.\n",
            "Judges can lower the minimum sentence and adjust fines when there are “exceptional circumstances,” the Turks and Caicos attorney general said in a news release earlier this month.\n",
